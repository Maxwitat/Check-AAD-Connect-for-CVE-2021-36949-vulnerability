The script  will check if your Azure AD Connect is running a version affected by the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-36949. Affected versions are 1.6.4.0 and 2.0.3.0.
Run the script on the server that host the AAD Connect installation.

The script checks if the auto-upgrade feature is enabled. By default, it is but as explained in the version history, only some releases will be deployed by auto-upgrade. The last one that is marked as auto-upgrade is 1.4.25.0 from 28.09.2019, so Microsoft obviously rarely makes use of this function. Therefore, see the description of the manual upgrade process to make sure your AAD Connect is up-to-date.
